types
=====

`types` is a small Go package that provides simple helper functions on
arbitrary types. The aim is to provide drop in easy replcaements for rote
functions that are sometimes necessary.

If you stumble upon this repo and have an idea that seems to fit for an easy
drop in, please open an issue!
